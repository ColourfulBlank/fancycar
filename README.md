# FancyCar.ca code test

This project is build with react and redux, also used semantic-ui react and axios.

To be able to run is project, React.js, Redux semantic UI react and axios are required

To run project, in the root directory run command:
```
npm start
```
Then a website will pop up on the default browser

Current version of project mocked API calls, to hook up to real working API, remove line 116-127 and 146-151

For the requirement about sorting, I did sorting when loading up, first by name, then same name by availability

The second question is also included in the directory, under question-two sub-directory.
